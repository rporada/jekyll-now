# Incremental vs Incident Response

In [THE HEROISM OF INCREMENTAL CARE](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/23/the-heroism-of-incremental-care) Atul Gawande points out that:

> We devote vast resources to intensive, one-off procedures, while starving the kind of steady, intimate care that often helps people more.

I know that this Gawande is not writing about security, but this is a recurring theme. Taleb has made a similar point: Who gets more credit? The politician that put in safeguards to prevent a disaster, or the first responders that went in? 

I am not saying that first responders, emergency room doctors, and for security incident response teams are not necessary. They are, and they serve a great purpose. What I am asking is are we giving enough attention to the incremental care providers? 

What are the ways that we can avoid security incidents through incremental monitoring, checking up, and treatment.

Gawande describes the role of the general practicioner and the primary care provider in the lives of a patient. They get to know them over a long period. They learn about their history, and they take a pragmatic approach to treating a patient.

Another article from _The Atlantic_ [How Cubans Live as Long as Americans at a Tenth of the Cost](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/11/cuba-health/508859/) further supports the observations of Gawande. In information systems today we have tight integration of developers and operations. We want the developers to be involved with operations so that they see and understand how the system actually works. Operations teams should be part of development to understand how things work earlier. This mixing of the two communities allows for something like primary care. It gives us a better understanding of how our 'patients' (systems) health (operations) is. We are then able to be pragmatic about changes, and not resort to heroic efforts.

Can the same be done for security?
