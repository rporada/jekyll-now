I have been becoming more humble about security and the likelihood of success. I think we have to find a way to treat software or properties of a system as dynamic and constantly needing maintenance. A house HVAC system will work for years without service. When it quits though it is going to stop fully. If we had done some basic maintenance and up keep we may get it to last even longer. I want to see if security can be treated similarly. Security must be part of the basic maintenance of the facilities. It is not like the foundation or structure that are only visited every now and then.
