t2 / 2016 - Learning the wrong lessons from Offense (Haroon Meer)

* attackers write more code
* attackers have stratified their domain
  * people work in their niche and little else
  * people find vulnerabilities
  * people build exploits
  * people build toolkits
  * people use tools


Defenders need to be building their own tools or at least be modifying them
* humane software

* Least Privilege (and skewed incentives)
  * too little and you are yelled at
  * too much and you get no feedback
  * Feedback should be when there is too much if you want positive reinforcement
* Enterprise Obstacles (our attitudes to them)
  * "The Obstacle is the Way" Ryan Holiday

# Potential Advantages
* Network Awareness
* Custom Detection
* Custom *


# What we can do
* Expect Breach

Attacker's think in graphs, defender's think in lists
If you want to really protect your network, you have to know your network
The Enigma Conference TAO talk is a good example of the concept of "As Designed" and "As Built"

(One Concession) - he talks about the fact that you have to know every little bit of detail, but at scale that is not necessarily works. Looking at your system as graphs/chains allow you to look at things differently

"Do we have to build everything from scratch?"
  * NO!
  * The UNIX Philosophy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
  * The procurement department is looking for buzzwords, or "interactive" but maybe we should be looking at it from the Unix Philosophy
  * Funding vs Bootstrapping
  	* When you accept VC funding, it changes your mindset
  	* VC is about spending, bootstrapping is about how are we going to make money
  * "I am buying this thing from a vendor, why does it not meet my requirements" -- entitlement
* Tools become toolchains
