title: Introducing Security Thoughts 
---

For the past several years I have been researching computer security. In that ti
me I have tested, developed, identified vulnerabiliteis in many different system
s. I have also spent a lot of time researching the history of computer security
This blog is going to capture my experiences over these years, observations abou
t the state of security, and document my views on future directions. 

I hope you enjoy.
