title: Introducing Security Thoughts 
---

For the past several years I have been researching computer security. In that time I have tested, developed, identified vulnerabiliteis in many different systems. I have also spent time researching the history of computer security. This blog captures my experiences, observations about the state of security, and document my views on future directions. 

I hope you enjoy.
